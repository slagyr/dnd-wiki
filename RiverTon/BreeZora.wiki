BreeZora - Dust Lich

Her lair is in the center of CrescentForest

{{{
	Breezora, Breezora
	Ye en-ter-ing Crescent Forest, Beware! Beware!
	Tales of missing folk who go, You’ll Hear! You’ll Hear!
	Breezora kills them one by one
	And turns you into a skeleton
	Even the strongest one’s go down,
	To the ground
	They’re alive
	But dead.
    
	Green eyes they glow in a cloud of dust, They see! They see!
	Fools that gaze upon her eyes, They flee!  They Flee.
	For any shape her cloud may take,
 	Her evil spells will make you shake,
	And all the while her ghostly friends will watch
	You die,
	And wake,
	And become 
	One of them.
