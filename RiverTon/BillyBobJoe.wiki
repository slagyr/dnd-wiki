Born in the far West lands of Calif, Billybob grew up on a poor dairy farm.  His beautiful mother Mere,  and hard working father Bo, were leaders in their church, so throughout Billybob’s childhood he was immersed in the theology of Bahamut - the legendary Platinum Dragon God.  Farm-work made Billybob strong… unusually Strong.  While most men would whip a maverick to join the pack, Billybob would simply pick it up and carry it in his beefy arms.  In recent years, as young Billlybob Joe became a man, girls became a problem…  They swooned over his good looks and distracted him from his religious devotion and he strayed from his solid life ethics.  To get his life back on track, Mere and Bo decided to send Billybob off to his Uncle Teddy in Riverton, where he might refocus his studies.  Teddy enrolled Billybob in the local militia.  But when Billybob out performed all the other recruits, he was assigned to the Elite Guard.
