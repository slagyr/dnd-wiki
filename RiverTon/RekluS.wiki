Reklus was raised in the normal way a teifling is, in the slums of a city, tolerated by very few and loved by even fewer. He quickly grew tired of his sorry situation and wandered the world searching for not very much at all. Approaching his 19th year he noticed a fiendish parade and followed it, this led him to the lair of a cult which noticed his similarity to their deities and quickly took him in. His participation in the corrupt acts and his lineage quickly drew the attention of The Fiend.  The Fiend began watching Reklus,noting his tendency to use his fellow cultists for personal gain and his indifferent silence. Reklus' patron denies him its name or knowledge of how many share its boons. Grateful for the newfound power Reklus leaves the cult and renders it to nothing but ash, as both him and his master found their groveling annoying. Back on the road The Tiefling encounters a half elf who gives mention of Riverton, and seeing nothing better to do heads to the city.
Frazâ€™Urb-luu is the deacon lord of deception and illusion. Tell us does not know that he made a pact with him.
