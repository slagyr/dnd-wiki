Brother, 



    You must reconsider your alliances.  Sad though it is that Jaliva killed your wife and children, consider the riches that Jaliva bestows upon those loyal to her.  I have never seen so much gold in my life.  Just yesterday the Mountainside wenches delivered a wagon of gold, filled to the brim, along with food and supplies as a bribe for their safety.  Jaliva poured the gold coins on top of her hoard like drops in the bucket. 



	Oolag and his giant thugs will soon put an end to the resistance in Brotham and I’ve got spies infiltrating Onditan.  Soon that city will betray the Riverton scum and vow allegiance to Calif.  It’s just a matter of time before King Edwin bows his knee to Jaliva.  

    
        Now if the Doradan Elves would stop hunting down our men.  Jaliva has found their village and I marked it on the map included.  

    
        We could sure use your help brother.  Join us.  Perhaps you collect a couple Doradan heads soon to show good will.  No need to come to Jaliva's roost, she's coming to you any day now.  I had no choice but to tell her your location.  You now how it is.  I hope you make the right choice.
