!4 Since Last recap

CrescentForest : the party had been BreeZora and gained the other HalfDragonAmulet turning into the AmuletOfTheMetallicDragon.  BreeZora scared the bejesus out of them, but MardreD had a chip on her shoulder and attacked. BreeZora made quick work of MardreD and turning her into her undead servant.  The SausageSlammers made a run for it and barely escaped on their boat.

Upon returning to RiverTon, things are amiss.  '''Perception Checks'''
Soldiers missing from the gates.
Few people out in the streets.  The people who are look rugeed and send suspicious glances in the direction of the SausageSlammers.
Most shops are closed.
The DrowseyTortoise is a crowed Mess.
