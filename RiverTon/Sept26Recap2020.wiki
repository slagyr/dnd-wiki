!4 Sept 26 - CerdulO

	Upon finding the secret chamber and placing the figuring onto the pedestal and defeating the gargoyles, RekluS once again looses it, and passes out.  When he wakes a moment later, his eyes are glowing yellow and he speaks with a demonic low voice.  “You’ve done it.  You’ve found my secret little chamber.  I promised you a gift, and now you shall have it!  *Evil laugh*”  You vision grows clouding and you get the sense you are flying… flying over RiverTon.    That’s what it looks like.  They crew get a tour of RiverTaina ending in JelivA’s lair where they see her hoards of treasure, then they see JelivA breath lightning upon them and they wake.  They each gain a level.  However RekluS remain under control… he grabs the figuring and shoves it into his chest, then awakes.  He realizes that he has learned to cast Hideous Laughter as a cantrip, however he must tell a joke first.
