As a child, ZealoT was praised for his skill in combat along with his talent in the arts. Coming from two honorable families, much responsibility was placed on Zealot to do well and for many years he exceeded these expectations. As he aged as a young adult, Zealot brought much honor to his clan and was praised greatly in his successes. One unfortunate season a plague swept over TymantheR and many of the elder dragonborns were susceptible and died. A victim of this plague happened to be the clan-master of the clan ZealoT was in and with lack of a leader ZealoT tried to take the place of clan-master. It was decided that ZealoT was too young and not experienced enough to be clan-master yet and after a long debate between him and the elders, ZealoT left in order to find challenges that would prove his worth to his clan. The first place he looked for a challenge was in a town named RiverTon and after some arrangements ZealoT was placed in the RivertonEliteGuard.
