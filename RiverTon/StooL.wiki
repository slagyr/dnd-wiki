Myconid sprout, famous and revered for his telepathic communication abilities. StooL was escorted to MountainSide by several Myconic peers for diplomatic reasons (initial discussion to create a nation-alliance against Jeliva).  The diplomatic convoy was intercepted by TrotH’s gang and they were all murdered, except StooL, who was stuffed in a covered cage.  TrotH’s party stumbled across a batallion on RiverTon soldiers who bested them and returned the “treasure” (StooL) back to RiverTon, not knowing what it was.  KingEdward panicked upon seeing StooL, thinking the Myconid would suspect RiverTon of kidnapping him.  Owen, Harold, and Hayon escorted StooL home.
