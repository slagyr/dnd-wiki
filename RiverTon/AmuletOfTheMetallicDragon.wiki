Held by ZealoT

Requires Attunement

This amulet, when worn by a dragonborn, enhances their breath weapon power to rival that of true dragons.  You gain +1 to AC and Saving Throws.

The wearer exhales lightning in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

At level 11: DC 19, 12d10 lightning damage

At level 18: DC 23, 16d10 lightning damage
