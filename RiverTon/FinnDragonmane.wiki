About 300 miles to the south, people talk of the mysterious Elvish Clan of DoradO.  No mortal has seen their home, but every once in a while a Doradon Elf may visit local towns…  They are immediately recognizable by their golden eyes which is said to be from Gold Dragon blood in their ancestry.  17 years ago, a young lady named ElanA, wandered into her beloved forest and went missing for months.  She returned pregnant, with tales of a Doradan Elf, LauciaN, with whom she fell in love.  ElanA was shunned, for she was not married and LauciaN was nowhere to be seen.  With her new baby boy Finn, ElenA ventured back into the forest to find the city of DoradO and her beloved LauciaN.  For years Finn grew up in the forest learning to hunt and survive, rarely entering villages or towns, such that Finn learned to befriend forest animals and almost communicate with them.  Eventually, tired of his mother’s endless search for Dorado, Finn decided to leave ElenA and join civilization in the nearest city of RiverTon.  Finn’s uniquely sharp skills were immediately noticed by a recruiter and he was enlisted in the RivertonEliteGuard.
