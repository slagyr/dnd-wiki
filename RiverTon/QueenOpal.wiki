Queen of RiverTon
Wife of KingEdward
Sister of QueenEmerelda

Was a princess of MountainSide, and arranged to merry KingEdward.  She was reluctant to the affair.

Bored with her role as Queen of RiverTon and wife of KingEdward, and always looking up to her sister QueenEmeralda, QueenOpal is open the possibility sypothising MountainSide and colluding with JelivA. Were she to become the reigning Queen of RiverTon, she would have much to offer JelivA, or perhaps destroy her, or show her sister that she is the more successful.  In essense, she is bored and seeking drama, excitement.  Above all, is her love for her son PrinceEdwin.
