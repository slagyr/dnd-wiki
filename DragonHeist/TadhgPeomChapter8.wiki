Week 8 - Carnival Cruise & Free Booze
"Shocked" to find Mirt not around, but "check back later",
Food critic didn't like Tadhg's ale, but fond of the taters. 
Rum invented a delectable treat, the sour-salty pickle-tot!
Helga made delicious cookies, for a dwarf pretty hot!  
Yawning Portal, Renaire & Floon ready with scuttlebutt,
The unwelcoming Grahlhunds part of a devilish cult!?
A little birdie told Aiax to fly to Phaulkonmere,
Told dopple-gang must leave - are not as they appear! 
Our nimble-wright search, to the docks was centering,
What else do we do? Easy - breaking & entering! 
The Seamaiden's Fair was dinner, a show, and more!
Even had nims! But "these aren't the droids you're looking for". 
At the Portal we looked for signs of the shape-shifters,
Bonnie perhaps? Bruno stalked, stealthy, swifter.
But Bruno's dopple-disguise, came as quite a surprise. 
Said friends were posing as those of recent demise.
