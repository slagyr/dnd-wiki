 * Started in ZigguraT?
 * Hot, humid, smells like rot, animal sounds (rain forest?)
 * We fight a bunch of hyenas and orcs.  Two wings buggers grabs some stuff and get away.
 * Orc things are making ''red fizz'' and selling in Waterdeep.  They're making it out of mimics.
 * Catrina turns her head transparent except for her eyes and brain while casting a spell.
 * We head to the Big ZigguraT.
 * Coves in main room depict various scenes with commoners and gods? Snakes, bears, dog??  Golden jade.
 * Muddy room with Giant Crafish? Bamboo staff!
 * faught some crabs
 * Lost many hit points (3 per hour?) while taking a long rest because of the bad air.
 * got washed up by water room.
 * Pool room with young woman swimming.  Doubble-Door on opposite side.
 * Meets nimph.. half naked in pool of water.  Adiveses that we don't enter pool.
 * Nymph says a lot of stuff that's not really helpful, and also that the seaweed in the ziggurat can temporarily cure disease (from bad air?).  Has some acquaintance in the ziggurat which can help us get out.
