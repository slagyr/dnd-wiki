 * Met HalletH again in UnderMountain. She wanted us to stay and keep her company.
 * Headed back up... Tadhg told some stories and made some cash
 * Back at Troll Skull... Fern held things together.  We were missed.
 * BarnibusBlastwind comes in, tells use about riffraff in town, invited us to fancy party, bad guys dressed as staff. We should gather intel of their impending attack and prevent it if necessary. Reward of 50 GP each.
 * We go shopping, sold treasure, bought potions and improved our weapons.
 * Party.. castle... murder holes... bouncer...
 * Soldiers detain us. They are under control by a lightening blue rune that AiaX destroys. Soldier said his master said we should be brought into a room and given special instructions.
 * BrundellE turned us invisible and TadhG conned a guard into letting us into the party.
 * Doppleganger taking advantage of YalahGarlhund. We bound him and put him in the portable hole. ;-)
 * Yalah and other Gralhunds seem untrustworthy and are up to no good. She denied that the bard that was doing something disturbing to her neck was a DoppelGanger.
 * BrundellE eats bacon.  Dis on Wis, Int, Chr... Adv on Str, Dex, Con
 * In library, large elephant guy with servants.
