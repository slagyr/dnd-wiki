 * Met a traveling circus that had some automatons - but not the one you're looking for. - This actually happened in the previous session.
 * Met with a IstridHorn in a graveyard tomorrow about what happened at the manor - She's now a tenant of TrollSkullManor
 * Met with MirT the day after for some HarperS business. He wants us to talk with the DoppelGangers to see if they'll join the HarperS.  In conflict with EmeraldEnclave.
 * Need to meet with doppelgangers to try to get them to leave town (or take them off the board otherwise) for the EmeraldEnclave. In conflict with HarperS.
 * Found the NimbleWright from the GralHund's so you can find out where the StoneOfGolorr is - they've been kept busy by constant investigations so far so probably haven't been able to retrieve it.
   * We found NiM's child and destroyed it but no progress on locating the StoneOfGolorr
 * Someone cut holes in your bar and was stuffing food in it - your trusty kobold sidekick addressed it but something to keep in mind.
   * IstridHorn has been taked with taking care of this.
 * FerN had a dispute with an old acquaintance who called her AleahnA.
   * We tracked her down to a house where found her held prisoner by RizzeN.  We killed him and rescued FerN, brought her back to stay at TrollSkullManor.
 * PickleTots are a big hit!
 * Got in a long rest.
