 * Investigated Lighthose where the person who purchased the key we found in the mausoleum lives... filled with lots of unpleasant people offering gummies???
 * Met some unsavors dudes in the lighthouse who informed us of Losser's where-abouts.
 * Met LosseR in the sewer under the DandyMopps powdered wig shoppe.  BrunO got some kind of sewer plague that he needs to get cured.
 * Helped him kill some Kenku that stole the StoneOfGolorr from him.  Chased the kenku with the stone down, but another grabbed it and ran into a building.
 * Quiss gave the kenku a ring in exchange for the stone.  We left the building and got attacked by three Gazers.
 * Meeting with DoppelGanger - DenddritcH
   * HurG - henchman.  Works at the docks, was hoping to be hired by us but we got the impression he was deceiving us.  He left angry and Bonnie said he was probably going to find someone else to replicate (and kill).
   * GeofF - HurG thinks he's an asshole, he may have followed us around for a while?
 * The party came to realize that the DoppelGangers typically kill the people they impersonate, and Bonnie may be the only decent one so far.Â  Went back to TrollskullManor.
