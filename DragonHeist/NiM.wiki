NimbleWright help at the HouseOfInspiredHands.

He inigmatically gave life to a NimcleWright of his own creation.  This child was a bit of a rebel and was led astray (by the GralHund's), however.  It was the cause of the ExplosionOutsideManor.  

The party managed to find the child in an alley in CastleWard and destroy it.
