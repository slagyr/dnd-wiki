 * Mostly exploring.  Used copper(?) mask to open a hidden cellar full of quality liquor.  We took several bottles for Trollskull.
 * Several rooms with dining tables. In one, we heard a bell sound and a bunch of humanoid corpses materialized and fell on the tables. Monster food?
 * Found a burglar's pack with equipment, which Brundelle took.
 * Found a bone (?) hairpin which can be used to cast True Strike.
 * Went down to the second level. No blue flames in stairwell.
 * Room full of dragon skeletons on display.  Took two skulls and 5 additional dragon claws.
 * Shrine with dead humanoid.
 * Room with 4 female elf statues looking toward center, and a mechanical flying cube protecting them.  Many other statues of humanoids and other creatures.  Touched elf statue and said magic words to un-petrify a kenku and a human. They were apparently petrified by a basilisk. Kenku was petrified 20(?) years ago, human was recent and knows of Trollskull. Can only use each elf statue to un-petrify once per day.
 * Entered room with several owlbears, which attack.
