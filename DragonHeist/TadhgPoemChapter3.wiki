Chapter 3 - Giant Rats and the Opera of Tiamat

To make some coin, we heeded the old lady's cries,
Found in her lab below, Rodents Of Unusual Size!
Swarms of stinky rats, large as cantankerous cats!
Skewered, sliced, and set ablaze - finally won our prize.

Ventured on to PhaulkonMere; home of EmeraldEnclave.
Falcon says the world's natural balance must be saved.
A scarecrow who should be stiff, come to life at UnderCliff.
To join the green guardians, or go on a path less paved?

Troll Skull manor, home to our adventuring host,
Is apparently "opening soon", according to a ghost.
Died he did in a fire; tavern became funeral pyre.
Can spectres be hired, give back a barkeep's post?

Strange still the other workers; a right motley crew:
Dwarves? Huzzah! Of course they can handle a brew,
But grimy gharish Orcs? Can they even eat with forks?
Elves, humans, a Kobold! Can't yet decide which will do.

On to the Opera,  the promised fat lady did not sing,
Instead out from the Dragon, clanging blades did ring.
Foes sprang from Tiamats' loins, thugs looking to steal our coins.
Dealt them death, jumping balconies like we had wings.

What great tales await in chapter four?
Will it be the stuff of legend and lore?
