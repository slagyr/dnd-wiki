Our Kobold SnarF a candle-taker,
RenairE the fair, a fortune-maker.
Just find a gem, the stone of gollor,
Be a half-million dragons less poor!   
Away we went to GrahlhundManor;
Clearly, not one of us a planner.
The Lord's borders guarded from illegal intruders,
By twelve foot walls! We'd have to be shrewder.  
The Emerald's MelanoR, made wee BrunO quick as a kitten,
Back to the manor, yet his lock pick on the door no fittin'.
So up and over the wall with a rope and a blink,
Tried to convince stable boy with a nod and a wink.   
Into the house, the servants all cowering in fear,
A murderous mystery was unfolding quite near.  
Two Zent thugs standing over bloodied bodies was clear,
So shuffled off their mortal coils with sword and spear.  
The next room over a raucous fray had erupted,
More Zent thugs had GrahlHund's plans disrupted.  
Also Urstul Floxin with serpents in the sky!  
No matter to us - all scoundrels did die.   
The GrahlHund-s barely thankful, for they'd hired the thugs,
To get the Stone for them, but double-crossed with a shrug.
Automaton off to get the Gollor, so were we out of the place,
Yet BrunO kept lingering, got a smack in the face.
