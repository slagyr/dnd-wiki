Hylan Republic (Steampunk... Magitech with the emphasis on magic)
BrotherhoodOfTechnocrats (Steampunk... Magitech with the emphasis on tech)
The Rest:
OldKron - a large but relatively poor old kingdom - large military but mostly wooden airships... Like a European Imperial power after Iron Ships became a thing... still powerful but needs to change or will be eaten
SurlaN - the same as Kron but with different customs and history (in progress) - probably a bit of an Aztec feel
TheFaerieCourt - Seelie and Unseelie fae who live in The Vast (a bunch of tiny islands and rocks like a giant asteroid field)
TheHegemony - Dino People who are using biology to recently push out from their jungle borders (they are riding giant dino things into battle, have Pterodactylish members and are skirmishing with the great powers unsettlingly well)

Class dynamics are a thing in this world - so Hy'lan and the Brotherhood have very wealthy nations and are engaged in a cold war (occasionally with a hot skirmish)... everyone else with the possible exception of the Hegemony (people don't know as much about them) - is pretty poor.
You guys live and work from the edge of The Vast... but Bazzgor himself does not seem to hurt for funds.
