!3 Jay's recap:
You guys had to take shelter at a conveniently positioned floating inn on your way to get to the fremlin

The Hotel Kron, currently located in Ornia, a small kingdom that rebelled from Kron many years ago

There were five Eagle Aarakokra bards... (at the Hotel Kron in Ornia)

There was bungee jumping, a spinny ride, a gambling room...

And the same 12 hours just kept repeating themselves over and over

Every day at the same time a maid would trip over a mug... a mist kraken would attack the bar... etc

you guys tried to leave the first day - you were attacked by sky pirates who threw a fireball at you.Â  Pilot 13 suicided your ship into theirs, killing everyone

and then you woke up... even though you don't sleep... in bed at the hotel

lather rinse repeat until the crew figured out that there were a few artifacts that they had to gather - each of which gave them powers to find more

uhh... everyone died a lot

like falling at terminal velocity into a lake... that happened a bunch

getting destroyed by the kraken, eaten by zombies, thrown out into the sky, killed by pirates...

But eventually you solved it and the innkeeper revealed himself to be the God Pan... who gave you guys a coin that one person can use to reroll a single d20 every day

like a poor man's luckstone
