 * We stakeout the abbey
 * When some guards exit with the big warrior guy, we sneak in
 * Following the treasure map, we run into some undead.  Battle ensues. Got temporary hit points from MerricK.
 * After killing the undead we run deeper into abbey, the other inhabitants hear the noise and follow us... but PiloT13 blocks the door.
 * We kill Ozmandius (check him for loot).
 * Party searches corridors and trips lots of traps
 * We find the treasure, but it's fake.  Crystal minotaur.
 * Then we find real treasure... Living Iron Statue
