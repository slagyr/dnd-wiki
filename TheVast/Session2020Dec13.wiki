 * Session zero!
 * DrBazzgor sent us on a mission to collect his kobold, Kevin.  We flew our airship to Hailan and took a train to Waitax, where we traveled on foot to the estate where Kevin was to be found.
 * We eventually made our way into the boobytrapped, Christmas-decorated house and eventually caught Kevin, knocked him out and tied him up.
 * Kevin's furnace then attacked us, at which point MerrickGraybeard cleverly escaped with our quarry via a second story window.
 * After dispatching the furnace the party searches the premises, finding a '''potion of healing''', a '''potion of climbing''', and fine art garnering '''41 gp''' to each party member.
 * We decided to do milestones instead of tracking experience points.
