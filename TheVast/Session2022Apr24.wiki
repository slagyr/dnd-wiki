* turning undead on the skellies set off a chain reaction... bad idea.
* we escape on the ship, skellies burry themselves as we get far, long rest, then we go back and try again
* we find a rum bottle, then a dirty cigar
* the clues form a trail, and we make it!
* can see where monastery used to be, now in ruins, smoke coming out of crack in ground
* stair by tree, locked door, SladE picks, dining hall, doors
* meet 3 guards, they kick the kettle and more people unlock doors and appear
* Osmandius, Bayleaf, Odium, Acolyte, ...
* We convince Osmium joins us out
