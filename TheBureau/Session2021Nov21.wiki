 * We have all the ingreients!!! 
 * Need a book, Viserand needs alternate version for ritual in VekenVelve.  All of the demons will be attracticted to a single point... then they'll fight.
 * In Arimicos. Sovereight Vasidia takes us to dark granite tower.
 * In Vizerans big-ass house.  He wants us to go directly to Vekenvelve with his apprentice Zeltch.
 *  - Keep a low profile... Zeltch has seeming spell to disguise us as servents.
 *  - Gromphs quarters, Sorcere, near peak, enter school.  Need to get his book.  (The Binwar? Grimwar?)
 *  - Maitren Bainre might help, risky
 *  - Jarlaxle... or councel of mages, on which Vazerin sits, is unheppy with clerics of loth.  They might help shake things up and kill demons.
 * We get disguised as quagiths, and head to mage tower.  They tell us they're going on a goblin hunt and tell us how to get through tower.
 * Y'Lara convinces us to let he escape, in echange for freing Terlok and getting us the book.  She casts a protection spell
 * She frees Terlok and tosses him into the void, then turns into a Yochlol and summons a seccond.
