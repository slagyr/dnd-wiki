 * We have all the ingreients!!!
 * Need a book, Vizeran needs alternate version for ritual in VekenVelve. All of the demons will be attracticted to a single point... then they'll fight.
 * In Arimicos. Sovereight Vasidia takes us to dark granite tower.
 * In Vizerans big-ass house. He wants us to go directly to Vekenvelve with his apprentice Zeltch.
 * - Keep a low profile... Zeltch has seeming spell to disguise us as servents.
 * - Gromphs quarters, Sorcere, near peak, enter school. Need to get his grimoire (spell book).
 * - Maitron Bainre might help, risky
 * - Jarlaxle... or councel of mages, on which Vazerin sits, is unheppy with clerics of loth. They might help shake things up and kill demons.
 * We get disguised as quaggoths, and head to mage tower via a tunnel that Vizeran built to the drow city. There was a swath of destruction, like a tornado hit, in a path toward the school of magic tower. They tell us they're going on a goblin hunt and tell us how to get through tower.
 * Level 1 : Gr'lan (treasure hunting drow we found) helps us past first level of tower
 * Level 2 : Clockwork Abominations and Archon tries to block our path
 * Level 3 : A Clockwork Abominiation made it in with us. Sp did the Archon, YIKES!. Lost of Vrocks.
 * Level 4 : Misty Spirity stuff. We stick around to fight. Gr'lan morphs into Incubus. We put a stop to the monster following us and kill them all.
 * Level 5 : Goristo, Balor, Glabrezu, Marillth large demons.
