 * More death race. We made it roughly half way further around the track.
 * Dremorah true-polymorphed or main antagonist vehicle into a silver dragon, which is now fighting its former occupants.
 * Toab cast Maze to entrap one of the drivers for awhile, as well as slowed some guys down with spiderwebs.  Tried to polymorph a guy but no dice.
 * Free Candy popped a sideways wheelie to dodge two earth elementals and a wall of bones (Coy made that happen?).
 * Coy was also lighting up the enemy with his shower of death arrows.
 * Terlok and Sklar were mostly driving, repairing Free Candy, and pummeling enemies on the vehicle.
 * Takhui  (Donny's owlbear) was distracting one of the drivers but also getting f-ed up so disengaged and is hanging back until the group comes back around.
 * Our own earth elemental grappled a driver and dragged him under ground. Driver is out of commission.
 * Don'Eagle was mostly lasering stuff in giant eagle form, then blighted and rammed our closest competitor to stop him from getting on the Ramp Of Death or whatever.
