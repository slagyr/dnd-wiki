 * Stadium battle with giant bulls and flying eels continues.
 * Kyn goes down after bull attacks, a few guys are deaf after their thunderous roars.
 * Don'Eagle provides some healing, and after Kyn is back up he summons Bigby's hand to start pummeling stuff.
 * Brekrios kills a bull and continuous to be basically invincible.
 * Don'Eagle transformed into a red dragon and took on eels in the air.
 * Doldruks polymorphed one of the eels into a turtle, then dropped it over the prismatic sphere for extensive damage (and restrained).
 * Two of the bulls became petrified due to delayed prismatic sphere effects.
 * Reekock chased down and killed a bull, and rammed another.
 * Sklar flew up on his carpet and mounted one of the eels.
