I Toab Timbers wish to receive the secret of immortal life and power as a Lich from the party known as Smoak otherwise known as Orkus Lord of the Undead.

In return for my successful transformation into a Lich I do pledge my service and allegiance to Lord Orcus for the remainder of my existence in any of the planes or sub planes or a period of no less than 1000 years whichever is longer.

I will also act as Lord Orcusâ€™ agent on the Prime Material plane when Orcus is not present or able to be present and in return will receive dominion over one third of the world.

Upon placing my blood on this parchment I bind myself to the terms of this contract, at which point Orkus will begin instruction and preparation for my transformation.
