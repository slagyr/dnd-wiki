Orkus Lord of the Undead

Colors:   Red/White

Opposes EverloN

Biggest rival of the DemogorgoN and GarzZt and ThePaleNight or Dagon who are both Obyriths who are all much more powerful than LoltH

Dremorha: I feel the need to point out to Toab that this puts him as odds with my patron the RavenQueen...and that there may ultimately be consequences from this.  She is largely indifferent to the lessor mindless undead, but cheating death, which is her domain, displeases her

Jay Stiles: I mean... GohbR wouldn't like it either... or BahamuT... MeilorA might not care though she wouldn't dig the 1/3 of the world part
