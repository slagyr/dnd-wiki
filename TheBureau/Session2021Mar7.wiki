 * In Karazikar's lair we found a magical platform where many of us sacrificed a point of an ability score to gain an extra attunement slot.
 * We also found a cool bow (Coy), a magic belt that appeared to be a Biceraton family heirloom (Sklar), and a robe that lets you see invisible things (Coy again?).  Also a chest with 15,000 gp, 1,300 pp, and 10 gems worth 500 gp each
 * Don'Eagle cured Coy's dumbness.
 * In a book it said that a "Maze Engine" can alter reality, and it's in a labyrinth in the underdark. Karazikar was looking for this.  Also picked up a Modron robot follower, Brzzzit.
 * Collected Karazikar's central eye and some other eye stalks.
 * Wandered through the tunnels until we came to a fortress, which turned out to be a magical artifact which we now have and can shrink down to a 1-inch cube.
 * Got attacked by shadow demons, then some Vrocks and a bunch of other beasties, which Toab held off with a wall of force until they were sickened with radiance and fireballed to death.  Terlok and Sklar were also fireballed, but not to death.
 * Took a long rest.  3,095 xp each.
