Becoming a lich will require you to brew a specific potion and create a phylactery... which is an object that will house your soul for eternity.

Please see the scroll, sent in triplicate, in the drawer.  This is the 5th level ritual 'Capture Soul'.  When your party kills sentient opponents who are not from the outer planes... cast the ritual.  If you do it within 20 minutes of death, you will capture the soul of the deceased... which will appear to be a small coin in your hand.  One casting will capture up to five souls this way.  Place them in the velvet bag and continue collecting them until you get a hundred.  This will be needed for your phylactery.  Note that the bodies of the soulless will not be able to be animated into anything more complicated than a zombie or skeleton.

The Included Cylinder is for acquiring the materials needed for your transformation.  The list is... difficult to fill.  You will need:

Dragon's blood
The Venom of a Demon
An Angel's Feather
A Crushed Unicorn's Horn
A Vial of pure Arsenic
and finally - the heart of a sacrificed humanoid - leave this one for last as it must be fresh for the ritual to work.
