 * We still have an army of after defeating the PurpleWorm
 * We made it to MantolDerith, fought some Duergar that were attacking the Svirfniblin.
 * The gnomes gave us a jewel worth 5,000 gp in return.  They said the Duergar captured their leader, Yantha.
 * We found SladdisVadir.  He was under some sort of madness from an evil stone, and was killing sentient creatures and eating them.
 * Went to the Duergar and gave them the gem the gnomes gave us in return for Yantha.  Yantha and one of the Duergar were also under the evil stone's spell and they wouldn't tell the truth.
 * We went looking for the ZhentariM and [[GazrimDuloch][http://dnd.cleancoders.com/TheBureau.GazrimDuloch]], encountered a Drow party who betrayed them and killed their beholder and all Zhents except Gazrim.
 * Gazrim gave us a ring that points the shortest route to GravenHollow.
 * TerloK found the evil stone on one of the drow, and it cursed him too.  He destroyed it with DawnBringer and released the demon lord of deception within it, who returned to his own plane.
 * We got in a couple long rests and Don'Eagle cured the madness that TerloK and the others were under.
 * Sladdis decided to return directly to [[GauntlGrym][http://dnd.cleancoders.com/TheBureau.GauntlGrym]].
 * We left all the NPCs except Gront and the artificial guard thing (?) with Gazrim.
 * Also Peebles is with us, and Zilchen (drow wizard who lost his spellbooks).
