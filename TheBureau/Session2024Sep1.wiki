Went back to the arena last night to take on 'erreptile disfunction'.      
Basically we were surrounded for the 1st fight by about 12 gynormous ground reptiles. 
10ish hydras that started w 5 heads, and 80 or so flying wyervn.    
We found out the fountain in the middle could let us charm the hydra, and basically we sent them after the wyvern.   
The wyvern are almost 90 percent dead.   The hydras have taken a lot of damage, and grow more heads as they get hurt.   
We are not sure what the hydras will do when the wyvern are all dead.    
In the meantime, 2 of us are swallowed.. 
I think and there are some nasty lizards on the ground.  That we still have to survive for round 1 of 2or3.

Also, do the advantage let's you attack twice thing instead of advantage  When ever you can.  These ACs are low ish so far.

Actually 2 attacks at normal are better than 1 at advantage.

We also have to examine some glowing crystals and floating rocks.
