 * Vision of demon talk human--- ArN... in arena as he's working on machinery...  He's sucking in souls into his hands collecting them into a basket... Earth is being torn apart, erupting, turining into Hell.  These soul... coin in the basket... he looks out and calls out "Time".  Another deamon appears.. wings and stuff... ArN show coins (souls)... winged devil accepts and starts chanting.... Mephistopheles... ArN says "I'll kick your butt if you betray me". A 3rd devil appears... in glowing red hot chains, red skin, neatly dressed with staff, lighting crakling around skin, struggling against bonds.

"Everlon is in controll of Arch Devils who have done something to tamper with the separate of realms/planes. Which has resulted in large demon inccursion.  The purpose is to set up an existential situtuation that has to be resolved to weaken us so that we can't fight ArN.  ArN is the bad guy who's responsible... he met with LotH.  Find a way to tootle of with ArN... else she'll stir our brains.  "Focus attacks on machinery"
