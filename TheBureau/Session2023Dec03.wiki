 * Giants and dragons and players, oh my!
 * We fly to EverloN
 * Thinkgs look a bit off... griffon with glowing green eyes.
 * Half of us are disguised as half the other "A-Team".
 
 * Team "Xogthan" is shackled:
	* Reekoc (Micah)
	* Brekrios (Tim)
	* KYN (Adam)
	* Dodrulks (Jake)
	* DonEagle
	* SklaR
 * Taken to arena with Xogthan, who announces us and that we will first fight "kaiju", gargantuan monsters. The stone staues start moving and the battle begins.
 * There is a fountain or something in the center with butterflies flying around it?
 * Stone enemies are resistant or immune to at least cold, psychic, fire(?), and non-magical piercing and slashing and probably bludgeoning. They take full damage from lightning.
 
 * Team "Arn" goes to wizard tower:
	* ToabTimbers
	* Fistrid (Mike)
	* Arzhek (Chris)
	* DremorhA
	* TerloK
	* CoY
 * In the city we notice that we are being followed. Arzhek advises that we go into the sewers.
 * A four-sided clock is encountered in a blocked room. Mist in each direction. Puzzle created by wizards. Micah (kudos) solves and the party makes it into the first level of the wizard tower.
