 * Battle, we are in the midst of battle
 * Intense battles... close.  But the last two dragons flee and we survive.
 * The giants and dragons thought we were prisoners of the Alpha team and had attacked us.
 * Coy's mom dies in the battle. Her soul had been taken by Arn.
 * Toab makes an mysterious deal and raises 3 dragons and 8 giants that agree to help up.  They will act as our guides.
