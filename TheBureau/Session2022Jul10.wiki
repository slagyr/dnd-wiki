 * SeliS in a familiar bar, where we stayed as noobs "The Guilded Copper"
 * Hazy, pungent smell, hookas, PDAs, Troll bartender (attractive with purple tatoos, tribal).
 * Staff has completely turned over since our last time here.
 * HedonY (Mal, Eros) is the troll god that gives them the tatoos.
 * Sklar gets drunk and challenged Troll to arm wrestle, and wins!
 * MasterAmaro enters the pub, with lots of trolls and chained angel archons. He wants us to surrender our weapons and come with him.
 * Don drinks mind reading potion - 2 distinct thought patterns, 1 trying to get us to come or we'll "have to be tested here", the other scream of pain.
 * MalkentheT - evil goddess, patron of all succubie, from the abyss
 * We refuse to give up our weapons.Â  Big fight... trolls have lots of resistance/immunity (fire/lightning)
