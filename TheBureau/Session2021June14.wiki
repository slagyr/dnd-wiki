 * Continuing on our side quest to find Araumycos's heart, and to prevent his marriage to Zuggtmoy.  We're in a hurry to prevent this.
 * The entire adventure was a fight with gnoll vampires, drow vampires, vampire spell casters, and their boss, a Death Tyrant.  They were all looking for Araumycos's heart too (even though it was right around the corner).
 * The Death Tyrant charmed Terlok, who fought Sklar to protect it.
 * At the end Sklar found a cavern with what is apparently Araumycos's heart.
 * 10,000 xp each, but no rest and we don't get to level up yet.
