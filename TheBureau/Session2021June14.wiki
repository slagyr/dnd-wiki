 * Continuing on our side quest to find Araumycos's heart, and to prevent his marriage to Zuggtmoy.  We're in a hurry to prevent this.
 * The entire adventure was a fight with gnoll vampires, drow vampires, vampire spell casters, and their boss, a Death Tyrant.  They were all looking for Araumycos's heart too (even though it was right around the corner).
