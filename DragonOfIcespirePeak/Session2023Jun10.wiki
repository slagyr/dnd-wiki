'''Gnomengarde'''

- Mayhem rested up from prior quest, and headed back towards Phandalin

- Escorted two gnomes, two ox, and a wagon loaded with barrels of wine and a Crab mech.

'''Umbrage Hill'''

- Party decided to check out this quest on the way back home.

- Upon arriving, the windmill had been heavily wrecked by a recent wind storm.

   - Timing of storm coincided with the Storm-god-Talos-worshipping orc encounter en route to Gnomengarde quest.

- A MantiCore named Helicoptera had latched onto the windmill's tower structure, clawing at a woman —AdabraGwynn — inside.

   - A "competing" group of adventurers was already present: The Halfling Heroes.

      - Leader Quinn HighTopple and his little brother Parker were hiding under a bush.

      - New recruit BristleBait's makeshift armor was stuck to the manticore's spiked tail and was being thrashed about.

   - Mayhem saw the Manticore was mostly just very hungry.

      - Conversation revealed a WhiteDragon had stolen his kills twice in a tenday.

      - Mealy rations did not satiate, so RiGansi, aided by PucK, hunted two deer.

      - Helico devoured most of one deer, while ZharKain and PucK magically roasted the other, so Helico would have a gift for his wife VirYez and kits.

'''Phandalin'''

- With Manticore gone and windmill wrecked, Adabra was persuaded to return to town.

   - Promised a new home [presumably TarFen's] from CoiNin

- Upon entering town, a graveside service was taking place for FaeLie and TarFen .

   - Flowers placed on grave, then it was realized only TarFen had died in a recent Orc attack (again coincided with Mayhem's recent activity), while FaeLie was just badly wounded.

   - TarFen hailed that he died a hero. He came to FaeLie's rescue because "he wasn't about to take the blame for her getting hurt".

   - AdabraGywnn and FaeLie now able to move into Tarfen's old place, which was quickly cleaned up by Mayhem. Collaborating on healing arts for the town.

- Town Meeting (or more of a riotous mob) called to discuss how to handle rise of orc attacks, destructive storms, etc.

   - A "vote" was held, with residents contributing coin to whichever solution they liked best. Raise a militia to deal with orc attacks? Strengthen all buildings with stone to deal with storms/winds? Build a giant treasure-spewing balloon like Neverwinter's? Blame all problems on the Harengon? Focus on Phandalin's economic growth?

   - Mayhem helped sway the close vote by contributing to raising a militia.

- Job Board

   - Wooden job board couldn't be nailed to stonework, so was loosely hanging from rafters. Mended by Mayhem.

   - Coin was collected from OrsonTollerford, the Town Master HarbinWester's aide, for completing two quests.

   - New Jobs were posted to the Job Board — Jobs Available:
