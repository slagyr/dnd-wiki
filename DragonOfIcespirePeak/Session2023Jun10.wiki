'''Gnomengarde'''

- Mayhem rested up from prior quest, and headed back towards Phandalin

- Escorted two gnomes, two ox, and a wagon loaded with barrels of wine and a Crab mech.

'''Umbrage Hill'''

- Party decided to check out this quest on the way back home. 

- Upon arriving, the windmill had been heavily wrecked by a recent wind storm. 

   - Timing of storm coincided with the Storm-god-Talos-worshipping orc encounter en route to Gnomengarde quest.

- A MantiCore named Helicoptera had latched onto the windmill's tower structure, clawing at a woman —Adabra Gwynn— inside. 

- A "competing" group of adventurers was already present: The Halfling Heroes. 

   - Leader Quinn HighTopple and his little brother Parker were hiding under a bush. 

   - New recruit BristleBait's makeshift armor was stuck to the manticore's spiked tail and was being thrashed about. 

- Mayhem saw the Manticore was mostly just very hungry. 

   - Conversation revealed a WhiteDragon had stolen his kills twice in a tenday.

   - Mealy rations did not satiate, so RiGansi, aided by PucK, hunted two deer.

   - Helico devoured most of one deer, while ZharKain and PucK magically roasted the other, so Helico would have a gift for his wife VirYez and kits.
