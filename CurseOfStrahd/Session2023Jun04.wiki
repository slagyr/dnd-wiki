 * Level 3
 * We wander through the forest.  Smell of death.  Legs sticking out of bushes.  Man, dead, several days, holding letter: KolyanIndirovich.
 * Head to town.  Find wierd lock, and clockwork figurine.  
 * Make it to Barovia. Meet Granny Morgy.  She shows Alistair how to open lock with blood, and sells dream pies. Mentiond windmill at north of town.
 * We go to see Burgermeister/Mayor. But we stop to see crying lady first.  She lost her daughter, Gertruda.  Other daughter is in room, sad, bitten by Strahd?
 * We leave. Lady waiting leads us back, girl is gone. She was a ghost? Much of party has one or two levels of exhaustion from sadness.
 * We head to Mayor mansion. Meet him and Irina the daughter.  Gives us directions to Strahd?
 * Wolves howling south of town. They want us to take them to Locke. Burgomaster offers us 50 farthings to get Ireena out of town and away from Strahd -- at least as far as VelakI.

Silver is worth more than gold here.  A Farthing is a regional silverpiece, but worth one of our goldpieces here.
