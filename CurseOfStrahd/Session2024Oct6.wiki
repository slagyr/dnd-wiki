 *Â We go to LadyWachter's house at her invitation. She wants us to kill Izek, or potentially his stepfather the burgomaster. Her book club with then take control of Velaki, and supposedly show more mercy with the townsfolk. We tell her we need time to consider it.
 * In the evening we go to the inn so Nieve can meet with her brother Izek. He tells her their family was killed in an attack and he's been looking for her ever since. She was born in Barovia. He wants her to stay and has no interest in overthrowing his stepfather.
 * Nieve convinces Izek to pardon the family that were to be punished by death because of speaking against the burgomaster, if they recant. However he has them scourged first.
 * We decide to investigate the missing wine shipments. Radu agrees to come with us for 10 GP (big silver) up front.
