 * Visiting the coffin shop in Velaki, to try to get the sacred bones which were stolen from the cathedral, and which were protecting it from Strad's forces. This is needed to keep Ireena safe.
 * Find a secret floor in Hendrick's (coffin maker) room, with a bag, with bones. Alistair gets poisoned from a trap.
 * Volenta Popofsky comes out of her room. She wants the bag. We say no and try to leave, so she magically shuts the exit door and attacks with vampire spawns.
 * Dibby webs them which helps a lot, and Nieve turns several of them.
 * Corvus goes down during battle. A man named Cloud who doesn't like the gods or apparently Strahd offers to raise Corvus in exchange for a future favor. Corvus agrees and is restored to full health. This happens again and Corvus promises two more favors (as long as they don't include injuring his companions).
 * We try to escape through the window but it ''seems'' to be bricked up. Radhu eventually breaks through the exit door and we run, though a spawn blocks the exit and Wrex grapples and moves her out of the way.
 * We flee to the cathedral.
 * Long rest and level up to 5th!
