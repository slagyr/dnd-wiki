 * We've got the two orphans with us, Freek and Myrtle, from the hags' windmill.
 * We see a large decorated crate and hear a large creature growling and banging around inside. We can't investigate much because it's guared by two people.
 * We sell some stuff in town. Everything here costs 5x normal, and we can sell for normal price.
 * We go to the Blue Water inn. Host Unwin hears us mention hags and tells us to keep it to ourselves. He also warns us not to tell people we went to leave Barovia. He offers us a job, to investigate a missing shipment of wine.
 * We talk to another guy at the bar (who owns the decorated crate?) and has a monkey. He tries to get Dibby to tell him what he and unwin talked about.
 * We eat and get rooms. At night the heard of the guard, Izek comes looking for Nieve and demands to search the place. Nieve and Ireena hide in attic. There are large "nests", a chest, and a small handprint of wine or something near and alcove on the south side. Danika ushers us out and we are not able to investigate. Long rest.
 * Izek is scary, has huge demonic hand. Adopted son if the burgomaster. Apparently has the hots for Nieve and noticed she had light hair.
