 * Near the burning windmill (where the hags were), we move stone to reveal hole leading to a cave
 * inside we find bones, dried blood, knives, and a summoning circle.
   * Dibby suggests reconsecrating the room... maybe we come back later
 * We head to Velaki
 * Ambushed by Werewolves, direworlves, and wolves. Defeated them.
 * Coming up to VelakI, a swarm of ravens... our raven joins them.
 * Refugees are on the outside of the walled city
 * We had to bribe guards to get inside.
 * We had to trade our silver to the city and they took a cut.
