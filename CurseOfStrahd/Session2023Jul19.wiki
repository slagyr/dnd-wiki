 * Radu drinking at table in bar (slimey guy)
 * We talk to Ismark, the mayor's son, the new mayor.  He seems to want us to take his sister, Irina, to Velaky.
 * MistTouched vs SunTouched?
 * We agree, funeral now, take Irina after.
 * Zombies destract us on the way to church but we make it. 
 * Church is old.  Door covered with claw marks and burns.
 * Cresk, alternate destination if we can't get to Velaky, says Priest.
 * We find a box of holding (100 lbs 12 cubic feet):
 	* arrows
    * crossbow bolts
    * rations
    * water skins
    * torches
 * Bone aspergillum - attracts zombies
 * The shrunken, shriveled head of a halfling
 	* eyes move around living stuff.  As a bonus action once per day, the owner of the head can command it to sing songs about heroes of old. This causes all allies within an earshot to gain advantage on saving throws against being frightened. There is a 10% cumulative chance per use of this weird insight that the head crumbles to dust. 
 * An 8-inch-diameter varnished orb made from a nothicâ€™s eye : As an action target one creature within 15-feet. The target must contest its Charisma (Deception) check against your Wisdom (Insight) check. If you win, the eye allows you to magically learn one fact or secret about the target. The target automatically wins if it is immune to being charmed. There is a 10% cumulative chance per use of this weird insight that the orb crumbles to dust.
 * coffer w/wolf tongue 
 	* This tongue tapers to a thin tip which is curved into a ladle-like form. When picked up a lapping sound can be heard and the tongue will pull the wielder toward anyone who is wounded. If permitted, the tongue will magically lick away wounds involving blood (DM adjudication required). This ability may be used once per day to heal 5d4 + 4 damage. The amount rolled may be split among multiple targets. There is a 10% cumulative chance per use of this healing that the tongue crumbles to dust.
