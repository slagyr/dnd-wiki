 * As we leave the last battle with the zombies, a raven with blue tipped feathers falls before us. It's got silver barbs stuck in it.
 * Several bird men (stryx) attack us.  They seem to be made of cloth.  The big one can shoot silver barbs. We fight. Party gets hurt and Alistair goes down, but we make it.
 * We heal and feed the raven and Alistair takes the silver barbs (24).
 * When we get to the road the raven caws. It seems to warns us of danger. A black carriage approaches. Strahd gets out and confronts us.
 * We chat. He asks why he shouldn't just take Ireena now. We tell him of our promise to escort her to her destination. He looks at Nieve curiously and asks if that is her real name. Is she sure? He lets us go.
 * We continue on road to Velaki and take a long rest.
 * On the bridge where Dibby got shot earlier, we meet two revenants.  They are enemies of Strahd. They trade armor with Corvus. They say if we want to oppose Strahd we should go to Argynvostholt and meet Godfried William (?). It is west past the river, then to the South.
 * Before we get to Velaki we see our(?) windmill and investigate. There is a stone post with a three-pointed star (like Mercedes).
 * A blue-winged raven alights the windmill and starts squawking.
 * We knock on the door, Morgantha answers.
