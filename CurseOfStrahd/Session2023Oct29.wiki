 * Story telling competition - Dibby wins! Gets aÂ WerewolfManuscript and other stuff.
 * We learn more from Eva the fortune teller: MadamEvasTarotReadings
 * We examine the broken elevator apparatus at the face of the cliff near the waterfall, to see if we can't make it work. We can't, it's trashed.
 * Dibby tries to levitate up and drop a rope down for us to climb, but two undead guys see him and shoot him.  We scrap the idea and decide to backtrack to the main road and go the long way to Velaki.
 * Two guards on horseback ask us if we've seen some missing children.  We soon find children's tracks and follow them into the forest. We encounter a group of zombies, including one that spreads disease and some child zombies. We dispose of them with modest damage to the party.
 * We find some goods near the zombies - silvered crossbow bolts, healing kits, holy water, and more.
 * We take a short rest and head back to the main road.
